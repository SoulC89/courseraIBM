    "For visualization, we will be using the longitude and latitude to see where the accident took place. We will be combining it with our new severity code to see which areas are hit hardest. \n",

    "We will also be looking at vehicle types as well as the contributing factor to see what kind of vehicle and what actually caused the accident in the first place. From there we can try to make guesses towards what causes the worst accidents. "
